I think it's the one who speaks and who will lead to the client and who can also serve the
manager. We have the clients. Okay, so who is the manager? Who can provide the guidance.
So, what we do is we build their tools, basically. We take their tools. Training, helping how to
balance it.
And then, they help us out. Okay. If they have warranty, we change or we repair whatever it is
for them.
And if they don't, they pay for their repairs. So, do you send them a quote for their repairs?
Okay. After payment, they will send us.
Okay, perfect. The logistics and food safety. Transportation, the warehousing and food safety
comes together.
Transportation. When the officers request food from the clients, we arrange them and then we
dispatch it to the clients. Dispatch it to the clients or to the carers? Residents.
Okay. Residents. Okay.
Now, when it comes to transportation, the problem we face is that we don't have a way of using
the car. That's one of the problems. Okay.
So, how do you calculate the delivery fee? The location of the... You use Uber? Yes. Okay. And
we also have a dashboard sheet that we... Google sheets.
That we... We track every payment. That's for payments. We track every payment when it comes
to the legitimate site.
And it's identified at how much we pay. So, if the client pays more, they have to come out. We
edit it in the Google sheets.
So, you edit what's in the Google sheets? We edit the... The paid amount in the Google sheets.
So, the amount is there. So, when the client's paid, we expect that to be a particular amount.
We just get the amount to be paid. Right. So, we just do that.
So, it depends on the actual amount. We show what's left. The client is still paying.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Is there more? Okay. Oh, you supply the chemicals. Okay.
So, every month, we send them the maintenance fee. The maintenance invoice for every
month. Every 25th of every month.
Perfect. Is it for the past month or is it prepaid? So, if the client is paying for January, we have
written dates for January. The due date is Monday.
Okay. So, the 25th is for the client. Okay.
Okay. Can I ask a question? Yes, please. Okay.
So, how is scheduling done? Sorry? Scheduling. How do you schedule the pools? Which carer
should go to which pool? Okay. So, every pool is assigned to a particular pool.
Let's say there are 10 pools. There are 10 pools. 10 to a pool carer.
Approximately. Approximately. And there are 6. That ranges between 8 to 15.
8 to 15. Yes. It ranges between 8 to 15.
Okay. So, now the scheduling. How is it done? How is it done? Is there a priority? Yes.
So, they have a particular date. They go. They maintain each time.
And they visit twice a week. A week. Yes.
Okay. So, if, for example, Adon is maintaining 8 pools or 10 pools, he visits, for example, for
Miss Mary's, he visits twice. Mondays and Tuesdays.
Wednesdays and Fridays. Saturdays and Mondays. Right.
Is it the same every week? Yes. So, it's Mondays and Thursdays for Miss Mary. Yes.
It's Mondays and Thursdays every week? Every week, yes. Okay. I don't think it's set in stone.
It's set in stone. It's set in stone. So, okay.
Okay. So, if the client is not available? We schedule. Because there's an agreement the client
has to make on the access to the pool.
To the pool. So, they go regardless of whether the client is there or not. Yes.
Okay. So, then the client has to give them access even if they are not there. They have to visit in
order to access it.
Right. So, in the app, should we make available? Because currently, there's reschedule. Okay.
Should it be? Reschedule would be normal. Okay. Because in that case, you're giving the client
time for it to meet.
Okay. To say that to the other one, they cannot come. And so, they cannot schedule
themselves.
Every day, they ask a number of things they have to attend to. To get that point. So, if we give
value, we are creating, we will create another unbearable problems for the carers.
And so, let it be set in stone that Monday is the carer will come to you, to your house, to your
table. Friday, the carer will come to your house, to your table. So, it becomes a routine thing.
The client is aware. So, it doesn't fluctuate for anybody to mess it in between and all of that. You
get my point.
Yeah, it makes sense. It makes sense. Yeah, I wanted to ask one more.
Is it, the rescheduling, is it an opportunity for the client to reschedule or the cleaner to
reschedule? So, If clients should reschedule at a fee too, you wouldn't be open to it? No, not
then. Delivering the chemical to them. So, if, should you say that the chemical is 10 cents and
on the invoice you put delivery date.
Believe me, you will say that 10 cents is already delivered to you. Yes. So, We sell at a price plus
15, is it 15? 15% markup to the customers.
We don't tell them whether it's delivery or not. As long as we are delivering for free, we are
okay. But I think it's out.
Ah, okay. So, Bro, as long as you are not taking their delivery, If the product is 10 cents and you
put 5 cents on, say 15 cents, they are okay. You prefer that.
But if you try to put the invoice as well as the delivery fee, You come across the delivery fee and
give them 15 cents. Yes. So, As long as it's an ADP who's delivering the chemicals, it has to be as
15%.
We deliver the chemicals. Okay. Yeah.
Okay. So, So, that's why I asked for ADP separation. Right? So, who can run a letter? Okay.
Who can, chemicals are going to be like 15% higher than the pusher. Because the PooCare
represents the technical service. Alright? And it's an inherited ADP customer service.
If we are not careful, they will use the free feeding to disturb them. So, once it's like that, it's a
lot. We also, from pusher, we retail through PooCare to them.
Together. Yeah. And it's tied to this particular product.
Okay. I remember that. You said you wanted to have a particular sensor.
I want to make sure. Because I told T-Lite to collaborate with T-Lite with their pricing and
everything. So, I remember you said to T-Lite, you told them to move this part to the Amazon
line.
Okay. Because, I'm just asking, because that means that you have to sign the contracts before,
before the return. No, it's not before the return also.
We sign the contracts before the year on what they want to do. Yeah. But, if they are on time to
reach the goal, then they can say that it's small.
You didn't tell us that it's small. If the PooCare gets there at a certain time, we can say that's
fine. We didn't sign on the first call.
So, we are not sure that we are coming to this part. I think that it must have been, I don't know,
planned or mission. I don't know.
The only time, no. But they still said that they are not coming. She wanted him to come once in
two weeks, like stop coming twice a week.
The argument that he rejects is that of course it is. Okay, so there's nothing like... to make sure
that the days are not reduced. Right.
No, no. If we do that, that's what cuts our access. When it comes to the days, the original
contract is twice a week.
Some clients are not happy and yet they want to maintain their pool and keep the water fresh.
So we can basically say, this is the pool once a week. Or once a month, they should have it.
But how about the... I remember that Pukeweiss don't do that. He makes the work extra
difficult. He makes the work extra difficult because nobody runs the pool the way he's
supposed to run it.
However, if the client is not in town, then you would maintain the pool twice a week. Exhausting
chemicals and getting them to pee, go, to have meat. Honestly, it's not fair.
So what can be done is that a client can subscribe to once a month, bail, and twice a month,
bail. Or twice a week. Or once a week.
So these four packages should be there. Okay. Not everybody would like their pool to be
maintained all the time.
It doesn't make sense. But I will address that side. Okay.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
So now what we're going to do is that we're going to come up with new pricing. We're going to
create the software platform and then the app. Now what Sasu is doing is, he's building us a
software, management software.
Platform. And an app. An app for the customer and an app for the carer.
All of them are tied to the platform. So whatever the carer does, the carer has routine. He has
to go through.
Now with this idea of they get to the entrance, they send a grouping and all of that, I don't think
we're actually monitoring it well. So what he's doing is that he's tied in an AI feature and Google
Maps. All right.
So he gets to the location. He sends the pin to the platform that, yes, I am here. And
immediately he sends it.
The next thing, the app will guide him as to the steps to follow. So the app will not allow you to
skip in. And whatever you do, it's updated on the platform where the client also sees it.
And when all is said and done, a message will be sent to the client automatically that the carer
has completed his task and he did A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. He's left the house. Do you get my point?
So in that case, the carer cannot lie. And you can also review.
The client can also review. Yes, absolutely. Do you get my point? So the carer cannot lie or send
the same Google Map to… No, they don't send it.
So they are only allowed to start a job. So there's a button called start a job if they are within the
range of the premises. So the button only comes if you are on the premises.
So you can't start a job without being… …within the premises. Are we going to all of the clients'
case to know that… Absolutely. We have to onboard.
We have to onboard every client. And to set every client up with the app. With the app, yeah.
Yeah. So basically, the software is seeking to eliminate excuses. Like a desiccant attitude.
And that means… With the ring. Yeah. That one is not wrong.
And so if it's raining… Yes. If it's raining, everybody knows that it's raining. It can be confirmed.
But the system cannot confirm. The system. You have to get there.
Definitely, you must go. No, as in, it started raining and along the line, he can't get to the place
while it's raining. But he'll still go.
He still must go. No, if he's not going at all, there's no need for him to go. Nonsense reduction.
That's what I'm asking. Okay, so in that case… We know that… So in that case, that's what we
think. Should we give a room to say that you can update to say it is raining? Yeah, I think we
should give… Who? Because they are autographers.
Who? They all write photos, right? They all write photos. So immediately, he confirms it is
raining. The manager must call the client to tell the client that the carer says it is raining.
So please, he couldn't come as scheduled. But he will make it up tomorrow or after the rain.
Yes, after.
So in that case, there's no need. So what we're seeking to do is effective and accurate
communication. Do you get my point? Uh-huh.
It is a client… A carer has a client in view. It is suitable. A client will… A carer will catch a client
and say… A manager will catch a client and say it is suitable.
The carer is able to employ a delivery room from a tenant in the home area. But they are
saying, say, a client will have meetings about it. It is suitable.
And I say, okay. We can add the weather to it. We can integrate the weather in it.
Sometimes, like the rain, they may be able to, but they also call and say. They call and say. Yeah.
So we'll have to give the manager room to reschedule. Be able to reschedule from their end.
But not the customer or the carer.
Not the customer or the carer. So the manager must reschedule and ensure that the missing
bit is sorted out. Is that right? Yeah.
Can I comment on that? Sure. So Boaz was stating that they will give a step-by-step process for
the co-carer to follow. Does that mean that the co-carer, at the end of every step, they clock
something in? So it's a checklist.
So at the end of every step, they check. You take, yeah. Okay.
So once he completes the process, the system automatically updates it. Yes. The platform and
the client.
So he has to take it before it updates, right? Yes. Okay. That's his job.
So the ticket, is it going to be for each client? Maybe about more than one? No, this will be every
house. How I understand it is that, let's say, he gets there. It indicates that he's there.
He starts from, like, how? If the first process is for him to check whatever. After he's done, he
has to check the levels. After he's done, he has to tick on the app.
So that's what I'm writing, right? Yes. Okay. That's what I want to know.
So in addition to what Ms. Mary said, at that, is it going to be for each client? So he will check in
and out for each client's app? On Google? Yes. Yeah. After he's done with the pool.
Sorry. You're going to check, come back to the pool. Is it a long cycle? I think that's a working
day.
When is that going to start? You check. So he can batch? He can batch? Yeah, check everything.
Yeah.
Or if they ask, yes, no, you do everything. If you don't, I'm sorry. And I do it for, like, 15 minutes,
20 minutes, 30 minutes.
And then I do the batch. I'm just trying to. Okay, so Mary is thinking into the Lazy Dice mind.
One who wants to play like a designer. And wouldn't want to do the job well. But the system has
to be so clean.
So I think. So, okay. So can you give me an example? So what do they do that they can't skip?
Like something, like what? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Great. Collect all the debris and the leaves that is not submerged under the water. If there are
leaves that are submerged, he has to take all of them, the net and everything.
And then also he has to clear the oil. You know, Rosemarie Balfour. You see that sort of oil line
drawn on the surface.
You see the water line? So he has to clean the water line and all of that. And then after he's
done with all the things that he's supposed to do with his duty that day. After everything, the
last thing he has to do is to do a backwash again.
And check chemical content. I'm talking about the pool. The pool itself.
So he has to check the chemical content. That means that, you know, if chlorine is dropped
below 1.5, it's supposed to be between 1 and 3 GPM. If it's dropped below that, he has to drop
it out.
If he checked and the chlorine is gone high, he has to, you know, release it or whatever it is.
And then also, he needs to drop out the water. Now most houses have problems with water.
Do you get it? So the water plate will be there, but it will be optional. So, okay, I ask the client's
security to drop out the water. Do you understand? He has to stay in the zone trying to know
that his or her security has been asked to drop out the water.
Do you get it? And then when that is done, he needs to check if all valves are correct. The pump
is in good shape. It's working all right.
The sound is okay. He also needs to check a filter pressure. It's within range.
He has to dust the pump and the filter to keep it clean and fresh. And then also, he needs to
make sure that the pump is very clean. Now interestingly, I have personally debunked the idea
of a client using the pump as a storage device.
When I get in there, and when we have a big group of our employees, kind of, I say the pump is
sandwiched and all of that. When we go out into the community, many of them don't know. So,
I was scared.
But luckily, none of my employees were there. They were shaking. Until I was able to catch
them.
Until I knew more than a few of them, their water had been clean. Do you understand what I
mean? Because if you keep stuff in there, it's a hazard to the carer. So, all these things, we need
to look at it and eradicate it completely from there.
So, I think that, from what I said, I think that after it's done to us, there should be the not
applicable option for everything. So, it's either not applicable. In the comment section, when
you said that I asked the security to comment.
And then, would there be, I'm just thinking of the top of my head. Would there be an option
where the client can also put in a comment? I think after. So, the review part has comments.
Okay, it has comments. Yeah. So, I think it should be either not or not applicable.
So, that means if it's not applicable, then we are going to have a discussion about it. All right.
And then, in that case, do you think we would go there? Go there.
Do you think we would go there for the duration? Duration from start to finish, yes. But not for
the individual. Because sometimes somebody can do their job and forget that he has to.
So, maybe you have to batch check the things. But some of them, even though you can batch
check them, you cannot skip the part where you put in the numbers. So, for instance, if you
check the pH, you have to put in the number there.
If you check, I don't know what else. I think there are quite a number of things he sent me. You
have to put the numbers there, so you cannot skip them.
Even if you check it, you still have to put in the number. Do you understand? I don't need
somebody to check everything for me. So, what I have to do is to say something like this.
Okay. So, that's why I said that's the option of not applicable. So, if it's not applicable.

What the business does (current operations)

The team supports clients with pool maintenance + chemicals supply + logistics (transportation/dispatch to residents).

There’s a manager who guides operations and communicates with clients.

The company also handles tool support: if a client has warranty, they replace/repair; if not, the client pays for repairs.

For paid repairs, a quote is sent, client pays, then logistics/repair proceeds.

Transportation & payments (current system)

A major issue: no proper system to manage/track car usage and transport reliably.

Delivery fees are based on location and they often use Uber.

Payments and balances are tracked in Google Sheets:

Expected amount is recorded.

When the client pays, the team edits the paid amount.

The sheet shows what’s left to pay (outstanding balance).

Billing / invoicing routine

Monthly maintenance invoice is sent every 25th.

It sounds like billing is prepaid for the upcoming month (example given: paying for January with January dates listed).

Scheduling rules (how visits are done)

Each pool is assigned to a specific pool carer.

Each carer handles about 8–15 pools.

Visits are typically twice a week, and the days are treated as fixed (routine), e.g., “Mondays & Thursdays every week.”

Client availability does not affect visits, because access is part of the agreement (carer goes whether client is home or not).

Strong preference: clients should NOT be allowed to reschedule, because it creates chaos and extra burden for carers.

Chemicals delivery pricing rule

Chemicals are sold with a ~15% markup, and delivery is not itemized.

They prefer “all-in pricing” instead of showing a separate delivery line item (to avoid disputes like “delivery was already paid for”).

Package idea (service frequency options)

They discussed adding flexible packages instead of forcing everyone into twice-weekly:

Once a month

Twice a month

Once a week

Twice a week (current default)

What the new software + apps must do (key requirements)

They want a platform + customer app + carer app (all connected), focused on eliminating excuses and improving accountability:

1) GPS-based job start (anti-cheating)

Carer can only tap “Start Job” if they are within a defined radius of the client’s premises (geofence).

Prevents carers from claiming they visited when they didn’t.

2) Step-by-step guided workflow (checklist)

When the job starts, the app guides the carer through required steps (cannot skip).

Checklist includes:

Remove debris/leaves (surface + submerged)

Clean waterline/oil line

Backwash

Measure chemicals (e.g., chlorine range) and enter numeric readings

Confirm valves/pump condition/sound

Check filter pressure

Clean/dust pump + filter area

Flag hazards (e.g., clients using pump room as storage)

Each step has:

✅ Tick/confirm

✍️ Notes/comments where needed

“Not applicable” option (but that triggers follow-up discussion)

3) Automatic client communication

Once completed, the system sends an automatic message to the client summarizing what was done (A, B, C…).

Client can review and leave comments/feedback.

4) Rescheduling rule (only manager can do it)

Rescheduling should not be done by clients or carers.

Only the manager can reschedule (example: rain).

If it’s raining:

Carer provides proof/info (photos were mentioned)

Manager calls client and reschedules appropriately.

5) Onboarding requirement

Every client must be onboarded and set up on the system/apps for this to work.

Biggest pain points the system is meant to solve

Carers “checking in” without actually doing work.

Poor visibility into what happened at each visit.

Transport/logistics coordination gaps.

Manual payment tracking and reconciliation via Google Sheets.

Client friction around delivery fees (hence bundled pricing approach).
