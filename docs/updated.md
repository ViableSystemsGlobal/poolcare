1. Overview — The Purpose of the App
The app should serve as a complete digital ecosystem for:
•	Pool owners – to monitor, manage, buy products, and book maintenance easily.
•	Pool Carers – to schedule, perform, and report on maintenance tasks.
•	PoolCare Management – to track jobs, manage clients, invoices, and chemical usage and sales.
The ultimate goal: automation, transparency, customer satisfaction, and service efficiency.

1.	ROUTINE CLEANING & CHEMICAL BALANCING
A clean pool is the foundation of a healthy swimming experience. Routine cleaning prevents algae growth, protects equipment, and ensures water clarity.
A.	Water Testing
•	Test and record water chemistry for key parameters such as:
o	pH level
o	Chlorine or sanitizer levels
o	Total alkalinity
o	Calcium hardness
o	Stabilizer (CYA)
•	Identify imbalances before they cause staining, corrosion, or cloudy water.
B.	Skimming
•	Remove floating debris such as leaves, insects, and dust from the water surface.
•	Prevent clogging of skimmers and filtration systems.
C.	 Vacuuming
•	Clean the pool floor to remove settled dirt, sand, and organic waste.
•	Maintain clear and hygienic water conditions.
D.	 Brushing
•	Scrub pool walls, steps, ladders, and tile lines to eliminate dirt and algae buildup.
•	Preserve surface finish and extend pool lifespan.
E.	 Emptying Baskets
•	Clean skimmer and pump baskets regularly to improve water circulation.
•	Prevent blockages and strain on the pump system.
F.	Final Water Testing
•	Test and record water chemistry for key parameters such as:
	pH level
	Chlorine or sanitizer levels
	Total alkalinity
	Calcium hardness
	Stabilizer (CYA)
•	Identify imbalances before they cause staining, corrosion, or cloudy water.
G.	 Chemical Balancing
•	Add the appropriate chemicals to restore ideal water conditions. Tick which chemical has been added or used:
	Multi-function Chlorine
	Classic Chlorine
	Instant Chlorine
	pH+
	pH-
	WaterClear
	Metal Control
	Pool Algae Clear
	Enzyme Clarifier
	PoolCare Clarifying Gel
	Grease and Oil Clarifier
	Urea Remover

•	Ensure swimmer safety and protect equipment from scale or corrosion.
•	Maintain correct sanitizer levels to prevent bacteria and algae growth.
 
2.	EQUIPMENT INSPECTION & MAINTENANCE
Preventive care ensures equipment operates efficiently and extends its service life.
A.	 General Equipment Inspection
•	Examine pumps, filters, heaters, and chlorinators for signs of wear or malfunction.
•	Detect and correct issues early to avoid costly repairs.
•	Ensure the pump room is clean and clear at all times.
B.	 Filter Cleaning / Backwashing
•	Clean or backwash filters to remove trapped dirt and maintain water flow.
•	Keep filtration systems functioning efficiently.
C.	 Saltwater Systems Maintenance
•	Inspect and clean the salt cell to ensure consistent chlorine generation.
•	Check salt concentration levels for optimum operation.
D.	 Lubrication & Seal Care
•	Lubricate O-rings and seals to prevent leaks and wear.
•	Maintain smooth mechanical operation and prolong equipment life.
